# Welcome to my Github Page

My name is Luke Pryor and I'm an aspiring Software Developer from Auckland in New Zealand.

Here I'll be showcasing projects I have either worked on in the past, as well as stuff I'm working on right now.

A lot of my projects will do with Websockets, Twitch API, & Real time data.
